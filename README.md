### Configuration 
First of all, we need to configure the system for C development.
If you are on Windows systems, what you need is an IDE to run the code with (CLion, for example).
If, on the other hand, you are on Linux systems, you can opt for the solution loved by everyone, namely to compile and run the code from the terminal

To compile and run a file, open a shell and type the command:

```bash
$ gcc -o ${fileName} ${fileName}.c
```

At the end of this operation, if no error is printed on the screen, it means that the compilation was successful.
After that, you can run the command:

```bash
$ ./{fileName}
```
and our program will run independently
